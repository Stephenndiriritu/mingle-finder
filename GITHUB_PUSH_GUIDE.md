# 🚀 How to Push Your Mingle Finder App to GitHub

## Quick Steps

### 1. Create GitHub Repository
1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and log in
2. Click "+" → "New repository"
3. Repository name: `mingle-finder`
4. Description: `Dating app with PayPal integration`
5. Choose Public or Private
6. **DON'T** check any initialization options
7. Click "Create repository"

### 2. Connect and Push (Replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)

```bash
# Add GitHub as remote origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/mingle-finder.git

# Push your code to GitHub
git push -u origin master
```

### 3. Alternative: Use GitHub CLI (if you have it installed)
```bash
# Create repo and push in one command
gh repo create mingle-finder --public --source=. --remote=origin --push
```

3. **Invite Collaborators** (if needed):
   - Go to repository Settings → Manage access

## Important Notes

🔒 **Security**: Your `.env.local` file is already in `.gitignore`, so your credentials won't be pushed to GitHub.

📝 **Documentation**: The repository includes:
- `PAYPAL_SETUP.md` - PayPal integration guide
- `README.md` - Project overview
- Code comments and documentation

🧪 **Testing**: Use the included test script:
```bash
node scripts/test-paypal.js
```

## Troubleshooting

### If you get authentication errors:
1. Make sure you're logged into GitHub
2. Use personal access token instead of password
3. Or use SSH keys for authentication

### If remote already exists:
```bash
git remote remove origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/mingle-finder.git
git push -u origin master
```

### If you want to rename the branch:
```bash
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```
